Excellent. Confidence in execution is the most critical component. Here is a detailed, professional-grade GitHub Development Roadmap that mirrors how such a project would be managed and executed in a top-tier tech company.

This plan is designed to be your single source of truth, guiding you from an empty repository to a fully deployed, impressive application.

---

### **Project Execution & Tracking: A FAANG Approach**

Before we dive into the roadmap, let's establish *how* you'll track your work. This is as important as the work itself.

*   **Tooling:** Use **GitHub Projects**. Create a new project board with a Kanban template (columns: `Backlog`, `To Do`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done`).
*   **Task Management:** Every single task in the roadmap below should be created as a **GitHub Issue**. Assign issues to yourself and link them to the project board. This creates a visual and auditable trail of your work.
*   **Branching Strategy:** Use a simplified GitFlow model:
    *   `main`: This branch is your source of truth for production. Code only gets here via a Pull Request (PR) from `develop`. Your CI/CD pipeline should automatically deploy from this branch.
    *   `develop`: This is your main integration branch. All feature branches merge into `develop`.
    *   `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>`: All new work happens here. (e.g., `feature/12-create-eks-cluster`).
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** No direct commits to `main` or `develop`. Every feature branch must be merged via a PR. **Even though you are working solo, enforce a PR review process for yourself.** Create a PR template with a checklist:
    *   `[ ]` Code is self-documented and follows style guides.
    *   `[ ]` Relevant unit/integration tests are added and passing.
    *   `[ ]` Infrastructure (Terraform) changes are planned and reviewed.
    *   `[ ]` CI pipeline passes successfully on this PR.
    *   `[ ]` `README.md` is updated if necessary.

### **GitHub Repository Structure (Monorepo)**

For a solo developer, a monorepo is simpler to manage. Create one single GitHub repository. Inside, structure it by service/concern:

```
supplement-iq/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/          # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
│       ├── backend-ci-cd.yml
│       └── frontend-ci-cd.yml

### **The Development Roadmap & Checkpoints**

Here are the major milestones. Treat each one as an "Epic" on your GitHub board.

#### **Milestone 0: The Cloud Foundation (1-2 weeks)**
*Goal: Provision the core, non-negotiable cloud infrastructure.*

| Task (GitHub Issue) | Technology | Checkpoint / "Definition of Done" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup GitHub Repo & Project Board** | GitHub | Your repository exists with the folder structure above. Your Kanban board is ready. |
| **Provision Networking Layer** | Terraform, AWS VPC | Terraform successfully applies to create a new VPC, subnets (public/private), NAT Gateway, and an Internet Gateway. |
| **Provision EKS Cluster** | Terraform, AWS EKS | Terraform successfully provisions a basic EKS (Kubernetes) cluster in your new VPC. You can connect to it using `kubectl`. |
| **Provision ECR Registry** | Terraform, AWS ECR | Terraform creates a private ECR repository for your backend API service. |

**End of Milestone 0 Checkpoint:** You have a running, albeit empty, Kubernetes cluster in AWS, and you can configure `kubectl` locally to communicate with it. Everything was created via code.

#### **Milestone 1: The Search Core (1 week)**
*Goal: Get data into a search engine and build an API to query it.*

| Task (GitHub Issue) | Technology | Checkpoint / "Definition of Done" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Develop Backend API Skeleton** | Python, FastAPI, Docker | A FastAPI service exists with a `/health` endpoint. It's containerized with a `Dockerfile`. You can `docker build` and `docker run` it locally. |
| **Develop Data Ingestion Script** | Python, `requests` | A Python script that can fetch data from one source (e.g., PubMed) and print it as structured JSON. |
| **Connect Backend to Elasticsearch** | Elasticsearch Python Client | The backend API connects to a *local* Dockerized Elasticsearch instance. Create a `/search` endpoint that returns hardcoded results for now. |
| **Define & Apply ES Mappings** | Elasticsearch | Create an explicit mapping for your `studies` index with custom analyzers and field types. |

**End of Milestone 1 Checkpoint:** You can run the backend API and Elasticsearch locally via Docker Compose. You can run the ingestion script to populate the local Elasticsearch, and then hit `http://localhost:8000/search` to get real data back from it.

#### **Milestone 2: First Deployment - The CI/CD Pipeline (2 weeks)**
*Goal: Automate the deployment process. This is a critical milestone for your CV.*

| Task (GitHub Issue) | Technology | Checkpoint / "Definition of Done" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Write Backend K8s Manifests** | Kubernetes (YAML) | Create `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` for the `backend-api`. The service should be of type `LoadBalancer` for now. |
| **Create Backend CI/CD Workflow** | GitHub Actions, Docker, ECR | A workflow in `.github/workflows` that triggers on PR to `main`: (1) Builds the backend Docker image, (2) Pushes it to your AWS ECR repo, (3) Uses `kubectl apply` to deploy to EKS. |
| **Provision Managed Elasticsearch** | Terraform, AWS OpenSearch | Terraform provisions an AWS OpenSearch (or Elastic Cloud) cluster. The backend API is configured to connect to this, not a local instance. |
| **Deploy & Test** | All | Merge your PR to `main`. The GitHub Action runs successfully. You can hit the public URL of the AWS Load Balancer and get a response from your API. |

**End of Milestone 2 Checkpoint:** You have a live, public API endpoint. Pushing code to your `main` branch automatically updates the live service without any manual intervention.

#### **Milestone 3: The Frontend Experience (2 weeks)**
*Goal: Give users an interface to interact with your powerful backend.*

| Task (GitHub Issue) | Technology | Checkpoint / "Definition of Done" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Develop React Frontend** | React/Next.js | Create a functional UI with a search bar, results page, and a detail page for a single study. Use dummy data initially. |
| **Connect Frontend to Backend API** | `axios`/`fetch` | The frontend makes live API calls to your deployed backend's public endpoint. |
| **Provision Frontend Infrastructure** | Terraform, S3, CloudFront | Terraform provisions an S3 bucket for static website hosting and a CloudFront distribution to act as a CDN and provide HTTPS. |
| **Build Frontend CI/CD Pipeline** | GitHub Actions, AWS CLI | A new GitHub Actions workflow that on PR to `main`: (1) Builds the static React app, (2) Syncs the build output to the S3 bucket, (3) Invalidates the CloudFront cache. |

**End of Milestone 3 Checkpoint:** You have a fully functional, publicly accessible website (e.g., `www.supplementiq.com`) where anyone can go and use your search engine. The live link is ready for your CV.

#### **Milestone 4: Integrating AI & Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)**
*Goal: Add the "wow" factor that differentiates this project.*

| Task (GitHub Issue) | Technology | Checkpoint / "Definition of Done" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Build and Dockerize AI Service** | Python, FastAPI, Transformers | Create the `ai-summarizer` microservice. It has one endpoint `/summarize` that takes text and returns a summary. |
| **Deploy AI Service to EKS** | Kubernetes, GitHub Actions | Write K8s manifests and update the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the `ai-summarizer` service. It should be a private `ClusterIP` service. |
| **Integrate AI into Backend** | Python, `requests` | The `backend-api` calls the `ai-summarizer`'s internal Kubernetes DNS name to get summaries for studies. |
| **Implement K8s Scheduled Ingestion** | Kubernetes `CronJob` | Convert the data ingestion script into a container and create a Kubernetes `CronJob` manifest to run it on a schedule (e.g., daily). |

**End of Milestone 4 Checkpoint:** The frontend now displays AI-generated summaries for research studies. The data in your database is now being updated automatically without any manual script execution. You have a fully automated, intelligent system.
