### **SupplementIQ: Technical System Design**

This document outlines the architecture for an AI-powered supplement research and interaction checker.

---

### **1. High-Level Architecture**

The system will be designed as a set of decoupled microservices. This approach allows for independent development, scaling, and deployment of different parts of the application. The main components are:

*   **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** A set of automated scripts to fetch, clean, and index data into Elasticsearch.
*   **Core Backend API (Python):** The central service that handles business logic, serves data to the frontend, and communicates with other services.
*   **Elasticsearch Cluster:** The heart of our application, used for advanced search, data storage, and analytics.
*   **AI/ML Services:** Separate services dedicated to computationally intensive tasks like summarization and sentiment analysis.
*   **Frontend Application:** A modern, responsive web interface for users.
*   **User Database:** A relational database for storing user-specific data.

Here is a visual representation of the architecture:

### **2. Component Deep Dive**

#### **2.1. Data Ingestion Pipeline (The ETL Process)**

This is a critical, offline component that ensures your data is fresh and well-structured.

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **PubMed:** Use the official E-utilities API to fetch studies. Data is primarily in XML format.
    *   **ClinicalTrials.gov:** Provides an API to access study data, also primarily in XML.
    *   **openFDA:** A REST API for accessing public FDA data, including drug and supplement label information.

*   **Technology & Workflow:**
    1.  **Orchestration:** Use **Apache Airflow** (for a highly impressive, production-grade setup) or a simple `cron` job on a server to schedule the data fetching jobs (e.g., run daily or weekly).
    2.  **Fetching:** Write Python scripts using the `requests` library to call the source APIs. Implement robust error handling and rate-limiting.
    3.  **Message Queue (Optional but recommended for scalability):** As the fetcher gets data, it pushes raw data (e.g., XML content) into a **RabbitMQ** or **AWS SQS** queue. This decouples fetching from processing.
    4.  **Processing Worker:** A separate Python process listens to the queue. It takes the raw data, parses it (using `xmltodict` or `lxml`), cleans it (removes unnecessary HTML, standardizes units), transforms it into a structured JSON format, and may perform initial light AI tasks like keyword extraction.
    5.  **Indexing:** The worker script uses the official **Elasticsearch Python client** to bulk-index the processed JSON documents into the appropriate Elasticsearch index.

#### **2.2. Elasticsearch Cluster**

This is where you'll demonstrate your core search expertise.

*   **Hosting:** Use a managed service like **Elastic Cloud** or **AWS OpenSearch Service**. This handles the operational overhead of managing a cluster.
*   **Index Design:**
    *   `supplements`: An index for individual supplements. Documents would contain fields like `name`, `aliases`, `description`, `known_uses`, `ingredients` (nested object), etc.
    *   `studies`: An index for all research papers and clinical trials. Documents would have fields like `title`, `abstract`, `authors`, `publication_date`, `journal`, `full_text_url`, `sentiment_score`, and `summary`.
    *   `interactions`: A dedicated index for known interactions, with fields like `substance_a`, `substance_b`, `severity`, and `description_of_interaction`.
*   **Mappings & Analyzers:**
    *   Define explicit mappings for each field to control how data is indexed (e.g., `text`, `keyword`, `date`, `float`).
    *   Create a **custom analyzer** for medical text. This analyzer should include:
        *   A `lowercase` token filter.
        *   A `stop` token filter with custom medical stop words.
        *   A **synonym graph** token filter. This is very important. It allows a search for "Vitamin C" to also match documents containing "ascorbic acid". You will need to build this synonym list.

#### **2.3. Core Backend API**

The brain of your application.

*   **Framework:** **FastAPI** is an excellent choice due to its high performance, automatic API documentation (via Swagger UI), and modern Python features. Flask is also a solid alternative.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Expose RESTful endpoints (e.g., `/search`, `/supplements/{id}`, `/user/profile`).
    *   Translate incoming user search requests into complex Elasticsearch queries (e.g., using `bool` queries to combine full-text search with filters).
    *   Handle user authentication and authorization using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
    *   Communicate with the User Database to manage user-specific information.
    *   Call the AI/ML services when needed (e.g., for on-the-fly summarization if not pre-computed).

#### **2.4. AI/ML Services**

Showcasing AI integration is a huge plus.

*   **Hosting:** Deploy these as separate, lightweight serverless functions (e.g., **AWS Lambda** or **Google Cloud Functions**) or containerized services. This prevents the main API from getting blocked by long-running AI tasks.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:**
    *   Use a pre-trained model from the **Hugging Face Hub**, such as `BioBERT`, which is specifically trained on biomedical text.
    *   Create an endpoint that accepts text (like a study abstract) and returns a sentiment score (e.g., positive, neutral, negative). This score can be pre-calculated during data ingestion and stored in the `studies` index.
*   **AI-Powered Summarization:**
    *   Use a pre-trained abstractive summarization model like `BART` or `T5` from Hugging Face.
    *   Create an endpoint that takes a long text and returns a concise summary. This can also be done during ingestion to speed up query time.
*   **Recommendation Engine:**
    *   **Content-Based:** This is easily implemented with Elasticsearch's built-in **`more_like_this` query**. Given a specific supplement or study, it can find other documents with similar text fields.
    *   **Collaborative Filtering (Advanced):** As users interact with the site (saving supplements, clicking on studies), store these interactions. Periodically, run an offline job using a Python library like `surprise` or `lightfm` to generate user-specific recommendations.

#### **2.5. Frontend Application**

*   **Framework:** **React** is the industry standard and a safe bet.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   A clean, intuitive UI with a powerful search bar.
    *   Search results page with advanced filtering options (by date, study type, sentiment).
    *   Detailed view pages for both supplements and studies.
    *   A user dashboard where users can save supplements and view their personalized recommendations.
*   **Hosting:** Deploy the static frontend build to a service like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **AWS S3 with a CloudFront CDN** for global low-latency access.

### **3. How to Approach Building This**

1.  **Phase 1: The Core Search Engine.** Start by setting up the data ingestion pipeline and your Elasticsearch cluster. Build the backend API with a single `/search` endpoint. This is the foundation.
2.  **Phase 2: Build the Frontend.** Create the user interface to interact with your core search engine.
3.  **Phase 3: Integrate AI Features.** Begin with sentiment analysis during ingestion. Then, add the summarization service. Implement the "More Like This" recommendations first.
4.  **Phase 4: Add User Features.** Implement user registration/login and the ability for users to save supplements. This will provide the data needed for more advanced collaborative filtering later.
5.  **Phase 5: Deployment & CI/CD.** Containerize your applications using **Docker**. Set up a **GitHub Actions** workflow to automatically test and deploy your backend to the cloud whenever you push to your main branch.

By following this system design, you will create a project that is not only functional and solves a real-world problem but also demonstrates a deep understanding of scalable, modern software architecture—making it a stellar addition to your CV for any FAANG position.
